# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition is the process of digitizing human handwritten digit images. It is a difficult task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with a variety of flavors. In order to address this issue, we created HDR, which uses the image of a digit to identify the digit that is present in the image. In this project, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is  sed with the Tensorflow framework to Recognition of Handwritten Digit. It used  two pairs of Convolution2D and MaxPooling2D layers. The MaxPooling layer acts as a sort of  ownsampling using max values in a region instead of averaging. After that, we will use Flatten layer to convert multidimensional parameters to vectors. The last layer has a Dense layer with ten Softmax outputs. The result reflects the network guess. The 0th output indicates a likelihood of the input digit being 0, while the 1st output indicates a probability of the input digit being 1, and so on.

# Conclusion 
A convolutional neural network (CNN) can reasonably predict handwritten digits.  I successfully constructed handwritten digit recognition using Python, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning frameworks.  Handwritten digits were identified with 99.43% and 98.8% accuracy during training and testing, respectively.
